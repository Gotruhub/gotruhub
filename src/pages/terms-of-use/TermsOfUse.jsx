                  <p className='font-[600] my-2'>Option 1: Legal Action</p>
                  <p>
                    Any legal action arising from these Terms of Use, brought by either you or us (collectively, the "Parties"), shall be initiated in the state and federal courts of Anambra State, Nigeria. Both Parties consent to the venue and jurisdiction of these courts, waiving all defenses related to personal jurisdiction or improper venue. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is excluded. Claims must be filed within six months of the cause of action arising.

                  <p className='font-[600] my-2'>Option 2: Informal Negotiations</p>
                  <p>
                    To resolve disputes efficiently and minimize costs, the Parties agree to attempt informal negotiations for at least thirty days before initiating arbitration. These negotiations will begin upon written notice from one Party to the other.
                  </p>

                  <p className='font-[600] my-2'>Binding Arbitration</p>
                  <p>
                    If informal negotiations fail, any dispute (except those explicitly excluded) will be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration. You understand that this means you waive your right to sue in court or request a jury trial. Arbitration will be conducted under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, CAP A18, with hearings potentially conducted in person, by phone, or online. The arbitration will take place in Anambra State, Nigeria. The arbitrator’s decision will be final, though it may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law. Arbitration is not available for intellectual property disputes, allegations of theft or privacy invasion, or claims for injunctive relief.

                  <p>
                    If a dispute proceeds to court, it must be filed in the state and federal courts of Anambra State, Nigeria, with both Parties consenting to these courts' jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and UCITA do not apply.

                  <p>
                    No dispute related to the Site may be brought more than six years after the cause of action arises. If any part of this provision is found unenforceable, disputes will be handled by a competent court in the designated jurisdiction and the parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

                  <p>
                    To resolve disputes (except those excluded), arbitration will proceed under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. If the arbitration costs are found excessive, we will cover those fees. The arbitration may be in person, by phone, or online, and the decision will be binding unless the arbitrator fails to apply applicable law.

                    Arbitration will be limited to the specific dispute between the Parties. Class actions or representative actions are prohibited in arbitration.
